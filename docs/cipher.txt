Assignment: You are responsible for implementing the ciphering feature.
This feature should accept a ciphered string and return it deciphered.
The cipher will be stored in a file named key.txt, stored in a folder,
ciphers, (in the same directory of the program, or in the root of your project folder.)
This file will contain two lines, the first line is the actual letter,
the second line is the cipher match. When the cipher is accessed, it must be validated.
An example will be provided. Document this in cipher.txt.

      UML for Cipher.java
---------------------------------
             Methods
+loadKey() : void
+getAltKey(String) : void
+decipher(String) : String
---------------------------------
            Variables
+key1 : String
+key2 : String
---------------------------------
            loadKey()
Purpose: It is the default key and calls getAltKey to access key.txt.

Pseudocode: Calls getAltKey to access key.txt and is being used as the default if no alternate key is provided.
---------------------------------
            getAltKey(String)
Purpose: Read the encryption keys stored in key.txt so that it can be implemented in decrypt(String)

Pseudocode: First, it accesses the altKey's file. Then, it creates a scanner in the file
and reads the 1st(before encryption) and 2nd line(after encryption), so that you can read and store
the before and after encryption values. I also added a part that checks if only the encryption line was given. So,
in that I bascially just scanned the first line, checked if there was a 2nd line, and if there wasn't I would
store whatever was in key1 to key2 and store the alphabet into key1 which can be seen in the first line of cipher.txt.
---------------------------------
         decipher(String)
Purpose: Get the encrypted text and then decrypt using the decryption key stored in key.txt.

Pseudocode: First check whether the length of key1 and key2 are the same length. If they are not,
throw an error because the characters would not match correctly. Then, Create a StringBuilder called
output to store the decrypted text. If they are the same length, then loop through each character in
the String text. For each character, store it in a variable called curr. Then, find the indexOf current
in key2. If it's found in key2, then use that to find and add onto output the corresponding key1 value
for that character. If it's not found key2, then output the original character that was found in the text.
Finally, you just return the toString() of output.
