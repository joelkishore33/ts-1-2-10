Software design & file handler plan

Inputs:
 - Request to read files (given index/file name)
 - Request to file with no args

Throughput
 - if requested to read files (with args indicating index/file name and/or decryption key), send file
   to cipher

Output:
 - return file contents as a String
 - return a list of all the files

Overall design:
 - userInterface reads user input and send request to programControl
 - programControl sends request to fileHandler (with/without args depending on what was requested from userInterface)
 - fileHandler send files to cipher (with or without unique key) or send back list of files
 - programControl return what the fileHandler returned
 - userInterface outputs what the programControl returned

UML for fileHandler:

fileHandler
-------------------------
+readFile():String[]
+readFile(String file):String
+readFile(String file, String key):String

Tests:
readFile(), return String[], Program should return a String array of all files.
readFile("filea.txt"), return (String content of file), Program should return a String of the contents of the file.
readFile("notAnActualFile.txt"), return exit & "Error: File cannot be found or does not exist", Program should exit and print the error statement.
readFile("filea.txt", "skjhakhdkfgdjk"), return contents of file a as a String, Program should return contents of filea deciphered with the given key.
readFile("notAnActualFile.txt", "skjhakhdkfgdjk"), return return exit & "Error: File cannot be found or does not exist", Program should exit and print the error statement.
