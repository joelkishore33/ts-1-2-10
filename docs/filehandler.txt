Software design & file handler plan

Inputs:
 - Request to read files (given index/file name)
 - Request to file with no args

Throughput
 - if requested to read files (with args indicating index/file name and/or decryption key), send file
   to cipher

Output:
 - return file contents as a String
 - return a list of all the files

Overall design:
 - userInterface reads user input and send request to programControl
 - programControl sends request to fileHandler (with/without args depending on what was requested from userInterface)
 - fileHandler send files to cipher (with or without unique key) or send back list of files
 - programControl return what the fileHandler returned
 - userInterface outputs what the programControl returned

UML for file reader:

fileHandler
------------
-content:String
-files:String[]
---------------
+readFile():String[]
+readFile(String file):String
+readFile(String file, String key):String
