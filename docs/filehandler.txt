Software design & file handler plan

Inputs:
 - Request to read files (given index/file name)
 - Request to file with no args

Throughput
 - if requested to read files (with args indicating index/file name and/or decryption key), send file
   to decryptor

Output:
 - return file contents as a String
 - return a list of all the files

Overall design:
 - main method read user input and send request to filehandler
 - filehandler send request to file reader (with/without args depending on what was requested from main)
 - file reader send files to decryptor (with or without unique key) or send back list of files
 - filehandler return what the file reader returned
 - main output what the filehandler returned

UML for file reader:

fileReader
------------
-content:String
-files:String[]
---------------
+readFile():String[]
+readFile(String file):String
+readFile(String file, String key):String
