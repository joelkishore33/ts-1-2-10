Software design & file handler plan
Pelin Sayar
2/12/26

The program should expect files in a folder named data (in the same directory of the program,
or in the root of your project folder.) When a request for a file is received, this part of the
program will return the file contents. This part of the program should handle all the direct
access to files.

Inputs:
 - Request to read files (given index/file name)
 - Request to file with no args

Output:
 - return file contents as a String
 - return a list of all the files

Overall design:
 - UserInterface reads user input and send request to ProgramControl
 - ProgramControl sends request to FileHandler (with/without args depending on what was requested from UserInterface)
 - FileHandler sends content of files requested back to ProgramControl or sends back list of all files in directory data/
 - ProgramControl sends what the FileHandler returned to Cipher
 - Cipher deciphers the content from ProgramControl and sends it back
 - ProgramControl sends content returned from Cipher to UserInterface
 - UserInterface outputs what the ProgramControl returned

UML for FileHandler:
FileHandler
-------------------------
+readFile():String[]
+readFile(String fileName):String
+readFile(String fileName, String key):String

Pseudocode:
    if no argument is given{
        path = "./data/"
        directory = new File(path)
        return directory.list()
    }

    if String argument is given{
        path = "./data/" + string argument
        content = ""
        file = new File(path)

        scanner = new Scanner(file)

        while (scanner.hasNextLine()){
            content += scanner.nextLine() + "\n"
        }

        if (content not ""):
            content = content.substring(0, content.length()-1)

        return content
    }

Tests:
readFileTest(): readFile(), return String[], Name of files should be the same as those in the directory "data/".
readFileWithCarnivoreTXTFileTest(): readFile("carnivore.txt"), return (String content of carnivore.txt file), Content of carnivore.txt should match what the fileHandler returns.
readFileWithCarnivoreCIPFileTest(): readFile("carnivore.cip"), return (String content of carnivore.cip file), Content of carnivore.cip should match what the fileHandler returns.
readFileWithCointelproTXTFileTest(): readFile("cointelpro.txt"), return (String content of cointelpro.txt file), Content of cointelpro.txt should match what the fileHandler returns.
readFileWithCointelproCIPFileTest(): readFile("cointelpro.cip"), return (String content of cointelpro.cip file), Content of cointelpro.cip should match what the fileHandler returns.
readFileException(): readFile("doesNotExist.txt"), throw an FileNotFoundException, Asking to read a file that does not exist should throw a FileNotFoundException.
